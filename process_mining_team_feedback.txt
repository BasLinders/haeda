- Can we detect the impact of displayed errors (JavaScript errors)?
- Can we use multiple sources in the upload?
- Can the Petri net be broken down into smaller, clearer paths?
- How often do users click back / toggle back-and-forth between page types?
- Visualize bottlenecks?
- Visualize happy paths?
- Gain insights into repeat purchases?
- Gain insights into returns?
- Gain insights into cart abandonment?
- Impact of up- and cross-sells?
- Speed of lead/transaction conversion?
- Can we estimate which landing pages are the most effective?
- And which ones are ineffective?
- Is it possible to track User IDs over a longer period?
- For example, what is the journey of social ads compared to Google Ads?
- Is it possible to highlight traces in the Petri net?
- Define KPIs based on the output (e.g., how many PDPs [Product Detail Pages] are viewed before conversion)?
- Can we use/display product- and category-specific data?
- After viewing which products do users drop off the most?
- Link ratios together (e.g., does a higher add-to-cart rate within a specific path lead to more conversion?)
- Apply segmentation to the data (device, session source/medium, etc.)?
- Can ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) be linked and included in the results/conclusions?
- Link this to traces/segmentation?
-Which landing pages lead to higher revenue/profit (and what happens in between)?
- Is it possible to categorize purchases by product category?
- Reverse path exploration: how is this reflected in the results?
